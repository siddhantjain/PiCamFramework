# PiCamFramework
A C++ based library for implementing filters for camera apps

## What's this about?

This is a test bed to try out experiments in computational photography. The idea is to create a C++ library that can be used with any platform (mobile/desktop/web). 

## What can be it used for now?
Right now, it is only good enough to use as a reference to set-up OpenCV with an XCode Project. You can simply use this project and hopefully everything should just work (i.e. You should see yourself in grayscale - assuming you have a webcam, i.e)

## What's coming next?
For now, this library (if I can call it that) will remain as is. I am planning to write an android app which uses this library. Once all these testing platforms are set, I can start working on developing the library itself. Will also give me time to decide what filters to work on: but I think I want to start with writing a portrait mode filter (just background segmentation, followed by blurring the background).
